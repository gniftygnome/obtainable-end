# Obtainable End
Make end portals obtainable in survival.

You do not need to ask me in order to use this mod in a modpack or to use
this code in your own mod.  However, I would love to hear about it so I can
check it out.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/gniftygnome/obtainable-end/wiki) for configuration and details.

## What does Obtainable End do?
Currently implemented features:
* Add a recipe for End Portal Frame pieces (requires a Nether Star and End Stone).
* Allow players to break End Portal Frame pieces (slowly, like Obsidian).
* Break associated End Portal blocks when an End Portal Frame piece is broken.
* Make End Portal Frames easier to place by correcting orientation when complete.
* Generate a global sound indicating a new End Portal Frame has been completed.

## What might Obtainable End do eventually?
Currently planned features:
* (none at the moment)

Suggestions are welcome.
